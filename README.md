# Employee-Tracker

This project is an example of a Content Management System (CMS) that makes it easy for non web-developers to interact with information stored in a database.  In this application, a company's employees can be viewed, added, and updated.  MySQL, Node.js, Inquirier, and Console Table were used to architect and build this CMS.
